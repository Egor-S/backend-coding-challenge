# Setting up the environment and running the server

Preferred tech stack was used.

1. Create venv (optional)
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `python scripts/import_data.py --input planning.json`
4. `uvicorn app.main:app`

## Features

* Data import script
* Normalized (?) database scheme
  * PlanningEntry
  * Talent (for talent and jobManager)
  * Client
  * Skill
* Fetching data (GET/POST, query params)
  * Pagination (offset & limit)
  * Sorting (all columns except of skills, asc/desc)
  * Filtering (all columns except of skills). Value from list, substring search (LIKE operator), value in range (datetime, float) **[extra time]**
* Reusable FastAPI dependencies (pagination, sorting, db session)
* Autogenerated docs at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
* Pagination & sorting
  * `GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/planning`
  * `?offset=100&limit=10` for pagination
  * `?sort=id asc&sort=talentName desc` for sorting
* Filtering
  * `POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/planning/filtering`
  * Pagination and sorting work (as query params)
  * `{"id": [1, 2, 3], "operatingUnit": "3", "startDate": {"min": "1671872621"}}`

~~I will implement filtering in another branch (because I have exceeded recommended time)~~


# Backend Coding Challenge

At aspaara a squad of superheroes works on giving superpowers to planning teams.
Through our product dashboard, we give insights into data â€“ a true super-vision
superpower. Join forces with us and build a dashboard of the future!

![aspaara superhero](aspaara_superhero.png)

## Goal

Create a simple backend application that provides an API for a dashboard which
allows a planner to get insights into client and planning information.

You will find the corresponding data that needs to be imported into the database
in `planning.json`, which contains around 10k records.

## Requirements

1. Create proper database tables that can fit the data model.
2. Create a script that imports the data into the database (sqlite).
3. Create REST APIs to get the planning data from the database.
    1. The APIs don't need to be complete, just create what you can in the
       available time.
    2. Please include at least one example on how to do each of the following:
        1. pagination
        2. sorting
        3. filtering / searching

## Data Model

* ID: integer (unique, required)
* Original ID: string (unique, required)
* Talent ID: string (optional)
* Talent Name: string (optional)
* Talent Grade: string (optional)
* Booking Grade: string (optional)
* Operating Unit: string (required)
* Office City: string (optional)
* Office Postal Code: string (required)
* Job Manager Name: string (optional)
* Job Manager ID: string (optional)
* Total Hours: float (required)
* Start Date: datetime (required)
* End Date: datetime (required)
* Client Name: string (optional)
* Client ID: string (required)
* Industry: string (optional)
* Required Skills: array of key-value pair (optional)
* Optional Skills: array of key-value pair (optional)
* Is Unassigned: boolean

## Preferred Tech Stack

* Python 3.8+
* FastAPI
* SQLAlchemy

## Submission

* Please fork the project, commit and push your implementation and add
  `sundara.amancharla@aspaara.com` as a contributor.
* Please update the README with any additional details or steps that are
  required to run your implementation.
* We understand that there is a limited amount of time, so it does not have to
  be perfect or 100% finished. Plan to spend no more than 2-3 hours on it.
